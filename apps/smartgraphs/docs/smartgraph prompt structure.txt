problem

  Question: "When did Maria stop to talk with her coach?"
  
  build Annotation: "this is where Maria stopped to talk with her coach"
  
  Prompt 1.
  
    "Click on the point on the scatterplot where Maria first stopped to talk to her coach."
     
    "check my answer"
     
  Prompt 2.
    
    "Think about it. Look for the part of the graph where Maria's distance does not increase between time points"
    
    "Then, click the point on the graph where you think Maria stopped to talk to her coach."    
    
    "check my answer"
    
    
  Prompt 3.
  
    "Think about what it means for Maria to be stopped. It means that as time increases, Maria's distance doesn't"
    
    "Click 'show me' to see a movie that shows how you can see the points whose distance are the same"
    
    "show me"
    
    THEN:
    
    "Then, click the point on the graph where you think Maria stopped to talk with her coach."
    
    "show me again" / "check my answer"

    
  Prompt 4.

    "Watch the graph to see which point shows where Maria stopped to talk with her coach."
    
    "show me"
    
    then:
    
    "show me again"/"go to the next question"
  

problem 2

  "How long was Maria stopped?"
  
  annotation: "And she stopped for 2 minutes." (starting at 2 minutes; annotation is a double sided arrow or some such?)
  
  prompt 1.
  
    For how many minutes was Maria stopped? __ minutes
    
    
  prompt 2.
  
    Think about it. See if you can find the point where Maria started running again.
    
  prompt 3.
  
    "Think about it. Watch as we show where Maria started running again."
    
    "show me"
    
    "show me again" / "okay, next step" (revise)
    
    
    prompt 3-1.
      "At what time point did Maria stop to talk with her coach? At __ minutes"
      
      "check my answer"
      
      "Watch the graph to see how we know the time point at which Maria stopped."
      
      "show me"
      
      "So, Maria stopped at the 2 minute time point."
      
      "show me again" / "go to the next question"
      
      
    prompt 3-2
      "At what time point did Maria start running again? At __ minutes"
      
      "check my answer"
      
      "Watch the graph to see how we know the time point at which Maria started running again."
      
      "show me again" / "go to the next question"
      
      
    prompt 3-3.
    
      "So for how long was Maria stopped? __ minutes"
  
      "check my answer"
     
      "Think about it. Maria stopped at 4 minutes and started again at 6 minutes, so the time in between must be how long she was stopped. How long is that? __ minutes"
      
      
      
Subtleties and data modeling issues that come up here

1. it's great to have an 'annotation' field, but what is the interaction with an 'add slide to lab book' notion?

here's the mental model i have:

* make it possible for the systems to transiently show an animation (or annotation) as scaffolding, *without* saving to the slide
* in effect, what we're asking the student to do is build an annotation property by property
* let the user save:

 the slides they build up
 any "scaffolding" annotations they found helpful
 any explanation they make (or are prompted to make) of how they found the scaffolding helpful
 
* of course, save all the data about their path through the activity; we can provide aggregated reports for teachers and researchers that are different than the final "slide show" created by the students.


* UI for building up slide show? Maybe have 'slide' animate down to 'slide sorter' on the bottom. Remove next/back buttons on question prompt and replace with slide sorter? Insert 


data models

* for slide show and annotations
* for questions and scaffolds
* for responses


The scaffolding animation is the thing you 'replay' and the thing you can 'save to my slide show' Mind, it's also something you could build yourself.

command pattern and undo levels

addAxes
addDataSeries(...)
modifyDataPoint(...)
createPopupAnnotation
attachAnnotationToDataPoint(...)






---

what's the first thing you do?

create a slide
set it up with some data

don't make these commands too general -- think of them as buttons you can click and that manipulate the state of a workspace.




createSlide()
setAxes(... from data source ... )
addDataSet(..)


cloneSlide()

saveSlide()




addAnnotation(text='this is where maria stopped to talk to her coach')...

on mousedown, create the annotation ?



so there's a state machine here.
and a more-declarative (?) list of scaffolded responses
and the actions to take after each?



what are the 'buttons' that the student clicks
