/** @class

  A Session represents a single run of an activity.
  
  This allows an activity to be run multiple times within a single browser 'session'. User-created objects that are 
  referenced by name (such as Datasets and Annotations) can be scoped to the current Session, so that references to
  a dataset (for example) with a given name call up data created by the current user within the current session of the
  activity.

  Sessions are created in the LOADING_ACTIVITY state (which is revisited whenever an Activity is started from the 
  beginning.)
