/** @class

  This is the abstract superclass of all Annotation types. The various subclasses of Annotation have a corresponding
  'viewClass' property which identifies the SC.View class which is instantiated by the GraphView in order to view
  an instance of that annotation on a graph.

  Each instance of an Annotation subclass represents either an 'example' annotation or a 'session-scoped' annotation.
  'Example' annotations (those with isExample == YES) are created by the activity author when the activity is
  designed. Typical uses of such annotations would be to highlight a pre-chosen portion of a graph as part of a hint
  or tutorial within an activity. 'Session-scoped' annotations, by contrast, are created during a run of the
  activity. Thus session-scoped annotations can be created from student input. Moreover, restarting an activity
  creates a new session; thus annotations can safely be referenced by name within an activity, without the worry 
  that one student's annotations will overwrite another student's annotations.
  
  Within an activity document, annotations are referenced by type (i.e., class) and name. This allows the serialized
  form of an activity to reference specific annotation objects using any human readable name the author chooses to
  think up. Although the name of an annotation should normally be unique within an activity, a session-scoped
  annotation with a given type and name, if it exists in the current session, will be used in preference to any
  example annotation with the same type and name.
  
  Typically, Smartgraph commands should use the addObjectByName method of a GraphController instance to add an
  annotation to the graph. The addObjectByName method will find the specified annotation within the current session 
  if possible, or else within the set of example annotations associated with the current activity.

    name. The session disambiguates the Annotation records so that only the Annotation associated with the current
    "run" of the activity is called up when it is requested by name.
