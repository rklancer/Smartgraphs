/** @class

  A Dataset record represents an unordered set of DataPoint records that can be displayed on a graph or table.
  
  Analogously to Annotations, Datasets can be 'example' datasets, created by the activity author when the activity is
  written, or 'session-scoped' datasets, created by the student during a session with the activity. Datasets are 
  referenced by name throughout an activity, and that name should be unique within an activity or session. When a 
  dataset with a given name is requested, a 'session-scoped' dataset with that name, scoped to the current session, is
  searched for; if none is found, then an example activity corresponding to the current activity is searched for as a
  fallback.
