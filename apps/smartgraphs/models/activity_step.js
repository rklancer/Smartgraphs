/** @class

  An ActivityStep record specifies what is shown, and what interactions may occur, during a given step on an
  ActivityPage. It also specifies what step, if any, should be visited in response to the interaction that occurred
  during the step. As such ActivityStep is the most complex model in the Smartgraphs codebase.
  
  Bear in mind that ActivitySteps branch. The ActivitySteps in an ActivityPage are not necessarily visited in order;
  nor are they necessarily all visited at all.
  
  Furthermore, the currently loaded ActivityStep is considered to have substates. When a step loads, the system enters
  the ACTIVITY_STEP state. ACTIVITY_STEP (or one of its substates, i.e., a state like SENSOR_RECORDING that has
  ACTIVITY_STEP in its nextResponder chain) remains the current state while the user interacts with the Smartgraph
  application. When the user is done interacting with that step -- perhaps they have chosen an answer, or entered data
  to their satisfaction -- they can click a button to "submit" the step for consideration by the system. Submission
  is performed by the submitStep action defined in the ACTIVITY_STEP.
  
  Submission is only allowed when the step is in a "submissible" state. (The "submissible" state is not an 
  SC.Responder like ACTIVITY_STEP; when Smartgraphs transitions to using the new SC.Statechart framework it will be
  possible to fix this.) The rules for enablement/disablement of submission are as follows:
  
    - if 'shouldFinishImmediately' is true, the step is automatically submitted, unless one of the startCommands turns submissibility off. This would likely be considered an error.
    - if one of the startCommands disables submission as a side effect, submissibility will remain off untilsubmission is explicitly turned on again. Turning submission back on might happen as a side effect of a tool that is turned on or by the submissibility criterion
    - if, regardless of the startCommands, the submissibility criterion evaluates to YES, submissibility is turned on
    - otherwise, submissibility is turned on
  
  Steps also specify how to inspect the system state and choose the next step to load once the step is submitted.
  
  h3. What is specified in an ActivityStep record
  
   - the configuration of the panes on the right (split or single)

   - what graph, table, or image to display in each pane, and what datasets or annotations they should show.

   - any commands to be executed when the step starts, before user interaction is allowed

   - the "student's response" form to be included in the pane on the left

   - any text (such as question prompt or hints) to be displayed before and after the response form
   
   - whether this automatically move to the submitted state when it loads (this could be used to create a step whose only purpose is to execute some commands)
   
   - an "live" submissibility criterion that is evaluated whenever its input values change, and that is used to enable submission only when its value is YES

   - a set of commands to be executed immediately after the user submits the step
  
   - a set of expressions that evaluate to YES or NO values in order to determine which step to load next
     
   - whether this is a 'terminal' step; ie., whether failure to branch away from this step should be taken to mean that we have finished the ActivityPage itself
     
   - whether the UI should or should not show a button that submits this step;
   
   - the title of that button
   
   - whether the 'Next Page' button should be enabled, and should both submit the step and move on to the next page, when this step is submissible. (This is a shortcut so that, on the last step in a page, users don't have to click Submit and then immediately click Next Page)
     
  h3. Serializing an ActivityStep
  
  When editing the serialized form of an ActivityStep, bear in mind that value of many of the properties are expected
  to be Javascript hashes. Where possible the expected content of these hashes is described.
  
  Generally, those hashes reference Activity objects by name, rather than by url (or id), but exceptions are noted
  below.
  
  Where properties of the ActivityPage are explicitly documented to be record types rather than strings, then the
  associated property must be specified in the serialized format via the url or id of the relevant object, rather than
  by name.
