/** @class

  The sessionController manages "activity sessions".
  
  When a user (student) runs an activity, they can change any of the datasets and annotations defined in the activity
  document, and even add new datasets and annotations. However, these changes should be isolated to a single "run" of 
  the activity. This controller makes that possible.
  
  When a user starts running an activity, Smartgraphs calls the beginSession method of this controller. This creates
  a new SC.NestedStore and sets Smartgraphs.store to point to the new store. This nested store buffers changes to 
  records defined in the activity. When the student finishes the activity, the changes in the nested store are thrown
  away, leaving the datasets, annotations, etc. in a pristine state. This is invaluable anytime anyone wants to run
  an activity multiple times in a single "browser session", and is invaluable for saving authored activities (because
  it cleanly differentiates changes to activity records made in authoring mode -- which should be saved to the
  activity document -- and changes to those same records made while running the activity -- changes which should be 
  saved to a separate session record, or thrown away.
  
  The content of the sessionController is a Session object which will eventually contain metadata about the current
  session. Eventually, we will implement incremental saving of the contents of the nested store to a backend data 
  store, associating those contents with session metadata.

    This throws away the content of the nested store, leaving all activity records as they were before the session
    was started, and sets Smartgraphs.store to point to the original store defined in main.js. It also sets the
    content to null.
